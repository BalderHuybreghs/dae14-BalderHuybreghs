<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
![Celeste Image](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fimages7.alphacoders.com%2F901%2Fthumb-1920-901149.png&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=fa9d60b584b1a86815d76b8e161bf6c6bbadfda9e44e3ee7ad3d31a0d0c6e0b1&ipo=images)

Here's why:
* It is a well designed parkour-platformer game
* There are only 6 main controls in the game
* The player has the following abilities: move, jump, grab, dash and crouch
* The graphics are not too complex to recreate, while still providing a good challenge
* The levels are simple in design, only consisting of a few core mechanics used in intelligent ways
* The mechanics are well documented on the internet, making it easier to recreate an as-close-as-possible feeling
* There are some asset dumps and tools available to help with the development
* The game is very open to modding and provides a lot of information on its inner workings

## My version
This section gives a clear and detailed overview of which parts of the original game I planned to make.

### The minimum I will most certainly develop:
* Movement Mechanics
* Dash ability
* Basic Level
* Basic parkour mechanics
* Berries
* Wood platforms

### What I will probably make as well:
* Particles
* B-side timed level
* Death animation
* Breaking platforms
* Moving platforms

### What I plan to create if I have enough time left:
* Hair physics
* Particles
* Bubble when picking up b-side
* Visual effects / details
